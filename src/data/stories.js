As you glance around, you notice that the forest seems to stretch endlessly in all directions, except for two faintly visible paths in front of you. The left path looks well-trodden, the ground beneath it worn and soft from what must have been years of travelers. The right path, however, is covered in thorny vines, almost as if nature itself is trying to keep people away. You feel a chill run down your spine as you contemplate your decision.

After walking for what feels like hours, you stumble upon an ancient, moss-covered chest hidden beneath the roots of a massive oak tree.
